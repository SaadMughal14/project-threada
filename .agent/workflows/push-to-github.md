description: Always push to GitHub after making code changes
---

// turbo-all

After completing any code changes or fixes:

1. Stage all changes:
```bash
git add -A
```

2. Commit with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "type: brief description"
```
Use conventional commit types: fix, feat, refactor, docs, style, chore

3. Push to remote:
```bash
git push
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always push to GitHub immediately after making changes. Do NOT wait for the user to ask.
